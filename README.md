# take-notes-app 

## What is it 
A simple react app that allows users to take notes. Users can also perform all the CRUD operations as well as use other features of the app. There is no backend for this app, but user data still gets stored in local storage, thus notes are saved until browser history gets cleaned. 

## How to test 
- navigate into the current folder
- run `npm install` to install dependencies 
- run `npm start` to run the app
